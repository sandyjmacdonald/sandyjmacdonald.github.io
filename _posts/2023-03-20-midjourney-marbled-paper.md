I've been experimenting a lot with Midjourney's version 5 model and it's just remarkable.

The marbled paper textures below were all generated with the prompt `/imagine Marbled paper texture --v 5 --q 2.0 --ar 2:3`, some with an image prompt also provided to guide the colours, and others with just an extra text prompt like `blue and yellow colours` or `black and white suminagashi`, for example.

Infinitely unique marbled paper textures in about a minute.

Feel free to use these textures however you wish. ðŸ™‚
