I'm a bioinformatician, working at the University of York, with a focus on 
analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data.

Previously, I was Head of Digital Content at Pimoroni, creating learning 
materials and keeping their [online shop](https://shop.pimoroni.com/) spick and 
span.

Before that, I've studied for a PhD looking at iron acquisition and its role in
the virulence of *Pasteurella multocida* causing pneumonia in cattle, at the
Moredun Research Institute. I've also worked as a postdoc, building metabolic
models of the nutritional symbiosis between aphids and their bacterial
symbionts *Buchnera*, and as the C2D2 (Centre for Chronic Diseases and Disorders) 
bioinformatician, both also at the University of York.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with electronics, especially the Raspberry
Pi, photography, and many more things besides.
